<!-- Note: 
1. With pull requests:
- Open your pull request against "main"
- Your pull request should have no more than two commits, if not you should squash them.
- It should pass all tests in the available continuous integration systems such as GitHub Actions.
- You should add/modify tests to cover your proposed code changes.
- If your pull request contains a new feature, please document it on the README.

2. Select the type of change and title format for your PR, you are recommended to use these types for naming your branches, commits and PRs:
- feat:     A new feature 
- fix:      A bug fix 
- docs:     Documentation only changes 
- style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) 
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature 
- perf:     A code change that improves performance 
- test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests 
- build:    Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) 
- ci:       Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) 
- chore:    Other changes that don't modify src or test files 
- revert:   Reverts a previous commit  

The recommended format is as follows
branch - {type}/{your_account_ID}/{do_what}.
commit - {type}: {do_what}.
PR - {type}: {do_what}.

e.g. if your change fix a bug:
branch - fix/robot_1/fix_output_bug.
