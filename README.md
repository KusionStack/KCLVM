# KCL

Kusion Configuration Language (KCL) is an open source configuration language used in Kusion Stack. KCL is a statically typed language for configuration and policy scenarios, based on concepts such as declarative and OOP programming paradigms.

## Core Features

+ **Simple**
  + Originated from Python and Golang, incorporating functional language features.
  + Absorbs integrated language elements such as statements, expressions, conditions, loops, etc.
  + Type and data separation, schema declaration configuration definition.
+ **Stable**
  + Strong immutable constraint.
  + Compile-time type deduction, type checking.
  + Rule policy definition: attribute-centric constraint expressions, query results based on constraints.
  + Testable: assert, print, and test tools.
+ **Collaborate**
  + Configuration merge: compile-time configuration dependency graph substitution.
  + Configuration attribute operators: meet the needs of configuration override, merge, add and delete, etc.
+ **Engineering**
  + Schema single integration and declarative model assembly.
  + Tools + API granular configuration automation.
  + Rich built-in functions and system libraries.
  + Top-level data dynamic data input.
  + Plug-in system: reuse common programming language ecology.
  + Code organization: modules and packages.
  + OpenAPI model support: Swagger and KCL schema bidirectional conversion, CRD conversion to KCL schema.
+ **High Performance**
  + Works with the LLVM optimizer, supports compilation to native code and formats like WASM and executes efficiently.
